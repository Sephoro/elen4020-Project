abstract="Optimizing the performance of HPC software requires a high-level understanding of communication patterns as well as their relation to source code structures. We describe an algorithm to detect communication patterns in parallel traces and show how these patterns can guide static code analysis. First, we detect patterns that identify potential bottlenecks in MPI communication traces. Next, we associate the patterns with the corresponding nodes in an abstract syntaxtree using the ROSE compiler framework. Finally we perform static analysis on the annotated control flow and system dependence graphs to guide transformations such as code motion or the automatic introduction of MPI collectives.",
